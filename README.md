# MetisRegressionProject
The goal of this project is to analyze nfl wins from salary data. This is project 2 of my time at the Metis data science bootcamp. 

The end result is tuning and training a Lasso model. This data does not have incredible predictive capacity, but can get a testing RMSE of 2.84 and a training RMSE of 2.40

Data is scraped from spotrac.com and wikipedia.com
