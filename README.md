# MetisRegressionProject
The goal of this project is to analyze nfl wins from salary data. This is project 2 of my time at the Metis data science bootcamp. 

In the data folder you can see the final combined and cleaned dataset used for the modeling and generation of presentation graphics. In the utils folder is a small collection of scripts for web scraping / merging of different datasets.

The end result is tuning and training a Lasso model. This data does not have incredible predictive capacity, but can get a testing RMSE of 2.84 and a training RMSE of 2.40

Data is scraped from spotrac.com and wikipedia.com
